# v5.1 (r 405) Weble IoT Gateway

Helping you to optimize your building automation system is one of our main goals. To achieve it, we have developed our own monitoring system compatible with multiple protocols. You can automate your building by triggering commands, generating alarms, creating charts and reports.

You may create your own logic circuits, also complex ones, with our modern graphical interface, which simplifies the integration of your concepts. Discover a very efficient tool, an improvement compared with available products in the market. Our logic module is real artificial intelligence, helping you to configure your building automation system.

You can record the activities of the fieldbus and generate PDF reports, in order to monitor and archive the events of your installation. The monitoring module offers you a complete tracking of your building.

All Weble IoT Gateway functions are reachable from standard web browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera). You may perform configuration and maintenance from your computer, your tablet, your smartphone, on site (WiFi LAN) or remotely with the secure access Connect module.

Our VPN service is one of our best-seller service, with adoption by many local Swiss companies, and some multi-national companies mainly active in middle east and southeast Asia. All of our hardware & Windows software can connect to one of our distributed VPN servers either directly with a TCP connection or encapsulated inside an SSH or HTTP(S) tunnel to bypass firewalls. This VPN feature is very useful for remote maintenance of sites. Its P2P design also enables direct site-to-site connections.

The VPN services for remote maintenance and inter-site communication are currently paid by monthly fees subscriptions, and it is our goal to also offer smaller customers an on-demand pay to use option to access their remote sites / housing using crypto payments.

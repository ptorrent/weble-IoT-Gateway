# Weble IoT Gateway

Helping you to optimize your building automation system is one of our main goals. To achieve it, we have developed our own monitoring system compatible with KNX and Modbus TCP protocols. You can automate your building by triggering commands, generating alarms, creating charts and reports.

You may create your own logic circuits, also complex ones, with our modern graphical interface, which simplifies the integration of your concepts. Discover a very efficient tool, an improvement compared with available products in the market. Our logic module is real artificial intelligence, helping you to configure your building automation system.

You can record the activities of the fieldbus and generate PDF reports, in order to monitor and archive the events of your installation. The monitoring module offers you a complete tracking of your building.

All W-BOX functions are reachable from standard web browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera). You may perform configuration and maintenance from your computer, your tablet, your smartphone, on site (WiFi LAN) or remotely with the secure access Connect module.
